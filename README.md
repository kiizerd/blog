# Blog on Rails

Simple Blog web-app made with Ruby on Rails.

## Description

A simple blog app made by following the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide from the Rails website, but expanded a bit.  
I added styling with Bootstrap via the [bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-rubygem) gem.  
I also added a 'Tag' feature, so each 'Article' can have 0+ tags that describe the article and group it with other similiar articles.  
There are some 'Demo' buttons that will generate articles and comments filled with [Lorem](https://loremipsum.io) via the [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) ruby gem.

Making this was a lot of fun and I feel like I learned a good deal about how Rails works.  
I'm excited to create some more apps with it!
